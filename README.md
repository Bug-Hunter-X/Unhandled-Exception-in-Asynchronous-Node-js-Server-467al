This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Node.js applications: unhandled exceptions within callbacks.  The `bug.js` file showcases a server that can crash due to an unhandled error in a `setTimeout` callback. The solution, `bugSolution.js`, addresses this by using a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully.  This approach prevents server crashes and allows for more robust error management.
